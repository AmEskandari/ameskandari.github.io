Fencing

For fencing this term, we had our most important event of the year, club nationals. We were the first place six-weapon team! I was the alternate for our men's epee squad, which was stacked this year and beat Cornell in the finals to get first place for the men's epee event as well. The last time Dartmouth won first was in 2014, and winning this year was special for our coach Scott, class of 2014, who is graduating this year with his PhD. Scott saw the potential for our team this year and really pushed us to be our best. He recently said to me, "Wait, you don't watch fencing everyday before bed?"
