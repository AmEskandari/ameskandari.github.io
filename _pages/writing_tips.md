Below are some tips, mostly from other people, that I've compiled over my limited experience in writing research papers. I like Andrej Karpathy and Tom Cormen's writing.

General tips:

- Read some top papers in the conference/journal before you begin.
- The first sentence in a paragraph should tell me what the point of the paragraph is.
- Include math equations if relevant.
- You should make your code available.
- After you finish your first draft, go through the entire paper and delete any unncessary words. Also check all the prepositions to make sure they're correct.

Conferences: 

- Please, please use LaTeX. It is important that the look and feel of your paper is correct.
- Try a creative title. I should not get tired when I read it. Tom Cormen suggests titles like 'Algol 68 with Fewer Tears', 'ViC*: Running out-of-memory instead of running out of memory", '50 shades of grey codes'.
- Make sure your paper is exactly the page limit and not a single line less.
- Include a pull figure on the first or second page that gives the reader a good idea of what your paper will be about.

Some phrases that I like:

- "We propose/present a deep learning model that xyz." -Andrej Karpathy
- "Of note, we are the first to xyz." -Saeed Hassanpour
- "In closing, we xyz."
- Transition works I like: in addition, furthermore, moreover
