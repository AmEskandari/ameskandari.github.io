Hi. My name is Jason. I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Dartmouth College, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm interested in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

I work with [Saeed Hassanpour](https://www.hassanpourlab.com/) on deep learning for medical image analysis. I also work for Protago Labs, an artificial intelligence company based in my hometown in Virginia. 

I'm currently taking summer quarter classes in Hanover. In the fall, I will be studying at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Copanhagen. Next spring (2019), I will be doing an academic internship with the American University of Kuwait (AUK) in Kuwait City.

Last spring, I interned at Oracle's internet intelligence office.
