Hi. My name is Jason. I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Dartmouth College, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm interested in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

I work with [Saeed Hassanpour](https://www.hassanpourlab.com/) on deep learning for medical image analysis. I also work for Protago Labs, an artificial intelligence company based in my hometown in Virginia.

I'm currently in Hanover taking summer quarter classes. I will be studying at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Copanhagen this fall and doing an academic internship with the American University of Kuwait (AUK) in Kuwait City next spring (2019).
