Hi. My name is Jason. I'm a third-year undergraduate student at Dartmouth College, studying Computer Science. I'm interested in deep learning and computer vision.

I work with [Saeed Hassanpour](https://www.hassanpourlab.com/) on deep learning for medical image analysis. I also work part-time for Protago Labs, an artificial intelligence company based in my hometown in Virginia. Last spring, I interned at Oracle's internet intelligence office.

I'm currently studying abroad at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Lyngby, Denmark.
