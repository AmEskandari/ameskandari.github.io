Some Random Ideas
------
* Machine learning could help greatly with college admissions, especially since most colleges have large datasets.
* Calorie counting apps could use computer vision techniques on a picture to get the nutritional content of meals instead of having the user input items manually.
* An NLP model trained on religious and secular texts, used on government documents, could provide insight into whether some nations truly have a separation between religion and state.
* The histories for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are vastly different depending on whether they are written by an Israeli or a Palestinian. This difference is well-documented in the textbook [Side by Side](https://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830), by Sami Adwan. A machine learning technique using something like Doc2Vec could rank historical documents by their bias and shed new light on why the histories portrayed by each side are so different.
