I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2020 with the AB in Computer Science. 

At Dartmouth, I joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Kappa_Kappa" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Tri-Kap</a> fraternity.

In Fall 2018, I studied abroad in <a href="https://jasonwei20.github.io/posts/2018/12/blog-post-7/" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Denmark</a>.

I grew up in Fairfax County, Virginia. When visiting home, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbrArNvGD9Y" style="color:navy" target="_blank">tennis</a> and poker with my childhood friends.
