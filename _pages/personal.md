* As an undergraduate, I studied abroad in <a href="https://jasonwei20.github.io/posts/2018/12/blog-post-7/" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Denmark</a> during Fall 2018. At Dartmouth, I was a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Kappa_Kappa" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Tri-Kap</a> fraternity at Dartmouth, and I was also on the club fencing team at Dartmouth. Our club fencing team won <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2018/04/dartmouth-fencing-club" style="color:navy" target="_blank">first</a> at club nationals at Knoxville, TN in 2018 and second at club nationals at Lansing, MI in 2017.
* I grew up in Fairfax County, Virginia. When visiting home, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR-q7Vw2nUQ" style="color:navy" target="_blank">tennis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPmcU8u8MEc" style="color:navy" target="_blank">poker</a> with my childhood friends. I went to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/19/number-1-high-school-america-offers-real-head-start-268693.html" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> (TJ) in Alexandria, Virginia.
