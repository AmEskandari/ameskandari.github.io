I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2020 with the AB in Computer Science. At Dartmouth, I joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Kappa_Kappa" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Tri-Kap</a> fraternity. I was also on the club <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2018/04/dartmouth-fencing-club" style="color:navy" target="_blank">fencing</a> team.

I grew up in Fairfax County, Virginia. When visiting home, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbrArNvGD9Y" style="color:navy" target="_blank">tennis</a> with my childhood friends.

In Fall 2018, I studied abroad in <a href="https://jasonwei20.github.io/posts/2018/12/blog-post-7/" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Denmark</a>.

Like all humans, I will one day die. These pages will give an idea of who I am and what I lived for:

My research career is a function of these <a href="https://jasonwei20.github.io/thanks/" style="color:navy">people</a> (among others). <br>
