I'm not going to say that my passport is a record of my travels, because it's not. My passport was never stamped during my frequent travels in the Schengen Area, so at best it's an incomplete reminder of *some* of the places I went to. However, because I always hold my passport either in my hand or in my pocket when traveling by air, it is a powerful visual-temporal token that reminds me of the airports that I've been to.

**Keflav√≠k International Airport (KEF), Iceland:** I've always flown WowAir here, and I found Icelandic people to well-composed. As for the airport, it is beautiful, well-organized, modern, and well-designed. I once went from the front door of the airport to my gate in less than seven minutes. Food is way too expensive though.

**Copenhagen Airport (CPH), Denmark:** I passed here frequently each weekend when I traveled in the fall. I remember being totally unorganized when first arriving and was saved by other international students at DTU (Technical University of Denmark) that I met. I didn't draw any cash so I couldn't pay for the bus to school the first day, but the driver let me on anyways.

**Istanbul Ataturk Airport (IST), Turkey:** I flew through here when visiting my friend Orkan, who is from Istanbul. The place is an absolute madhouse. The free wifi only lasted for 2 hours and you needed cell phone service to use it, so I couldn't really use my phone to contact anyone. I waited in the customs line for more than 2 hours, and it was so hot from all the people I was sweating from just standing there, even though it was fricken December. I wasn't aware that I was supposed to get a Visa, which was careless of me, but somehow they let me in anyways. Leaving the airport, I had to go through two fricken security lines (one just to get in the airport), where there were guards with automatic weapons walking around.

**Vilnius Airport (VNO), Lithuania:** Lithuania is a small country, and VNO is an appropriately small airport. But is literally designed like a mansion. The building was clean, fancy, high-tech, and well-run. It is absolutely my favorite airport.
