*Time* is the only commodity that matters [(Randy Pausch)](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0). So how do we best use it?

# Working on the right thing
1. You must be passionate about what you're working on. Not sure if you're passionate about it? [Use the F\*ck yes or no rule](https://markmanson.net/fuck-yes). If you haven't found what you're passionate about yet, keep looking (Steve Jobs).
1. There are several benefits here:
	- If you enjoy it, it's no longer work. It's play. Don't you want to play?
	- When you're not passionate, you'll take the easy way out. But when you love what you're doing, the ideas pour out of your head, you'll actively seek ways to improve, and you just can't stop thinking about it. Passion can be difference between mediocre and exceptional work. 
1. If you're doing it just to get an easy paper, you started at the wrong place. You probably won't talk about those papers later anyways. If you think that you will regret doing something if you don't get a paper out of it, that's a red flag.
1. Quality of research heavily outweighs quantity. One conference paper is better than five workshop papers. One good conference paper is better than three marginal ones.

# Optimizing Work Time
1. Your time is the only thing that matters and must be protected at all costs. First, you must measure it in terms of *deep work*, because that's when you actually added value.
	- As Cal Newport suggests, you should log your deep work hours on a calendar next to your desk. Block off time on your calendar for it.
	- Begin it with a ritual such as refilling your water, closing the door, and clearing your computer screen. Use sensory cues such as lighting a candle, listening to your favorite playlist, chewing gum, and putting on your thinking cap. Your phone should not be in the room.
	- Isolate each task and make sure the objective is clear. When I can do this successfully, usually I win. 
1. Your job will inevitably also require shallow work (e.g., email, administrivia, fixing formatting to make your paper fit in the page limit). Don't use your deep work hours for this; in fact, you can do this on a separate laptop in bed, in the couch, or on your phone in the toilet.

# Avoid these things
1. Meetings should be only for weekly check-ins with your advisor or getting to know someone better as a person. [One meeting can blow an entire day of work](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). 
1. Regulate your email usage, and only reply to email when something bad would happen if you don't. 
1. The biggest attention suckers to avoid (for me):
	- Re-reading old email or slack conversations.
	- Spending too long composing an email.
	- Re-reading previous papers or text that I've written.
	- Applying to jobs and positions that I'm not actually interested in.
	- Admiring the LaTeX compilation and nice-looking figures.
	- Looking at people's LinkedIn or Google Scholar profiles.
1. Say no more often. Will something really bad happen if you say no?

# Optimizing Non-Work Time
1. Some activities depend on other people and can't be planned. For example, you have to adjust your tennis schedule based on the weather, or you have to wait for your brother to eat dinner. You can schedule a period in the day that is less structured, and have several non-work activities to fill up that time such as reading a book, playing piano, or organizing your computer files.
<!-- 1. Trade money for time when you can. -->

# Energy and Focus
1. You should also consider your energy since that will highly correlate with whether you can enter a state of deep work. 
	- If you want to sleep, go sleep. You will make a lot of mistakes if you're tired, and it's just not worth it unless you have an immediate deadline (how did you get yourself in that situation in the first place)?
	- Do not waste energy on things like thinking about something that happened at work or a rude email your co-worker sent. Meditate it off.
1. Make sure you eat well, sleep enough, and exercise. Your goal is to be successful over your career, not this month, and you need sustainable habits. It's OK to not meet a short-term goal that you've set, if it means you're increasing the probability of hitting your long-term goals. Steven King attributes his success to his healthy body and healthy marriage. 

# Mental Models
1. Compounding effects. Play the long game.

# Best advice from others.
1. Randy Pausch
- Be the *first penguin*. Take big risks.
- Donâ€™t complain, just work harder.
