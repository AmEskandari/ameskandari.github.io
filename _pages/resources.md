Deep Learning
------
* I took Andrew Ng’s [course](http://www.coursera.org/deep-learning‎) on deep learning and I thought it was really good.

* My notes for his course are [here](https://github.com/jasonwei20/course-notes/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Notes.pdf).

Random Ideas
------
1. Machine learning could help greatly with college admissions, especially since most colleges have large datasets.

2. Computer vision could be used on dating apps to suggest matches (it might already be used).

3. Machine learning could probably do better than average at fantasy basketball.

4. It could be a fun project to train a GAN on shoe designs. 

5. Calorie counting apps could use computer vision techniques on a picture to track nutritional content of meals instead of having a user input items manually. 

6. For career counselors, deep learning can shed some insight into what parts of a resume really matter when applying for jobs. 

7. It could be cool to train a CNN on images of the streets of the major cities in the world (or the streets of college campuses). 

8. The histories for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are vastly different depending on whether they are writen by an Israeli or a Palestinian. This difference is well-documented in the textbook [Side by Side](https://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830), by Sami Adwan. A machine learning technique using something like Doc2Vec could rank historical documents by their bias and shed new light on why the histories portrayed by each side are so different.

9. An NLP model trained on religious and secular texts, used on government documents, could provide insight into whether some nations truly have a separation between religion and state.
