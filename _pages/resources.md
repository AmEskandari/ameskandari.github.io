Deep Learning
------
* I took Andrew Ng’s [course](http://www.coursera.org/deep-learning‎) on deep learning and I thought it was really good. My notes for his course are [here](https://github.com/jasonwei20/course-notes/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Notes.pdf).

Random Ideas
------
* Machine learning could help greatly with college admissions, especially since most colleges have large datasets.
* Can you train a GAN to visualize (or even predict) the growth of a lung cancer tumor?
* Calorie counting apps could use computer vision techniques on a picture to get the nutritional content of meals instead of having the user input items manually.
* I think training a conversational chatbot on someone's personal facebook messages would be pretty funny.
* The histories for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are vastly different depending on whether they are written by an Israeli or a Palestinian. This difference is well-documented in the textbook [Side by Side](https://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830), by Sami Adwan. A machine learning technique using something like Doc2Vec could rank historical documents by their bias and shed new light on why the histories portrayed by each side are so different.
* An NLP model trained on religious and secular texts, used on government documents, could provide insight into whether some nations truly have a separation between religion and state.
