Deep Learning
------
* I took Andrew Ng’s [course](http://www.coursera.org/deep-learning‎) on deep learning and I thought it was really good.

* My notes for his course are [here](https://github.com/jasonwei20/course-notes/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Notes.pdf)

Random Ideas
------
* I think machine learning could help greatly with college admissions, especially since most colleges have large datasets.

* Computer vision should be used on dating apps to suggest matches (it might already be used).

* Machine learning could probably do better than average at fantasy basketball.

* I think it would be fun to train a GAN on shoe designs. 

* Calorie counting apps could use computer vision techniques on a picture to track nutritional content of meals instead of having a user input items manually. 

* For career counselors, deep learning can shed some insight into what parts of a resume really matter when applying for jobs. 

* The histories for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are vastly different depending on whether they are writen by an Israeli or a Palestinian. This difference is well-documented in the textbook [Side by Side](https://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830), by Sami Adwan. A machine learning technique using something like Doc2Vec could rank historical documents by their bias and send new light on the histories portrayed by each side are so different.

* An NLP model trained on religious and secular texts, used on government documents, could provide insight into whether some nations truly have a separation between religion and state.
