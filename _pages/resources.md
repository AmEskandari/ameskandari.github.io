Deep Learning
------
* I took Andrew Ng’s [course](http://www.coursera.org/deep-learning‎) on deep learning and I thought it was really good.

Random Ideas
------
* Machine learning could do better than average at fantasy basketball.

* I think machine learning could help greatly with college admissions, especially since most colleges have large datasets.
