Reading
------

I read Stephen King's Misery. 

This was my first Stephen King book, and I will admit that King is an incredible storyteller. I had always thought that good writing meant allowing the reader to focus on the content, but while reading this book, I stopped at many points, noticing how good King's writing was. His use of metaphors was so natural, his word choice was so intentional, and his control of language so masterful. Though the plot did not have as much action as I expected and it was more tame than I expected, the book felt crafted so carefully from beginning to end.
Apparently in good writers never use adverbs since they can always find the perfect verbs, and Stephen King proves this.
