Intro asdf

DoorDash
------

Interning at DoorDash, the market leader in food delivery, was so exciting.
For my first project, I served a new carousel on our feed page, which took about six weeks. 
The carousel retrieved the user's most recent order and recommended similar stores to the user. 
I created the entire system end-to-end, from the developing the machine learning algorithm and creating an ETL, to reading from recommendations from our search service database, and to finally serving the carousel from the feed service.
Every week, I felt like I was leveling up.

San Francisco
------

Being back in the city again was fine, except this time, many of my Dartmouth and Blend friends, who were here over the summer, went back to school. From Sep 27 - Oct 31, I lived in the [Winsor Hotel](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwj_5szen7vlAhXUFn0KHYHgAzQYABAAGgJwdg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQOD2R7T-APRicWd4SRBx69NJh9yOQ8hOd5dmBIL5E4jsJcr7Vdl1PN1T2pMW5XIFCwSfrxCFWDaH7xsBz8vVxrI&sig=AOD64_3sPJjJPGYKvH87QvvIFx9BdEzqZQ&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjhksLen7vlAhXVsJ4KHdN2AHgQ0Qx6BAgQEAE&adurl=), a one-star temporary housing unit just one block away from the DoorDash office. The price was good for my own room with a full-sized bed, but the location was not so great.

EMNLP-IJCNLP
------

The first day, I went to Deep Learning for NLP and Conversational AI tutorials, which were good. The second day, I went into the city to see the Tsim Tsa Tsui Promenade, the glamorous [K11 mall](https://hk.k11.com/), and Victoria's Peak. 

Some lessons that I learned from the conference:
- Some papers are marginal. They don't take big risks or advance the field substantially but demonstrate small improvements and are technically sound, and so reviewers often can't find good reasons to reject them. Don't work on these marginal papers. Dream bigger and take a risk. Even if you get rejected, you won't regret it.
- Not all papers have to be on methodological innovations. [[Example 1]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1051.pdf) [[Example 2]]()
- There are so many unsolved problems in NLP, and many papers introduced new unsolved tasks for us to pursue.

On the third day of the conference, my friend June and I took a cable car across the island to see the Tian Tan Buddha. 
I loved the views from the cable car, and the Hall of One-Thousand Buddhas was beautiful. 
That evening, we went to Hong Kong Disneyland, for which the conference had rented out Tomorrowland exclusively for EMNLP participants. 
We enjoyed the buffet dinner and went on the Star Wars, Iron Man, Ant Man, and Small World rides. 

The last day, I presented my poster during the last session. 
It seemed, however, that there was less interest than when I had previously presented at ICLR.
I had also added a sign saying I was a prospective PhD student, but unfortunately no professors came to talk to me.

Throughout the conference, I frequently went to the hot tub and sauna at our hotel, which was a great place for me to get away from all the sounds of the city and spend some time with my thoughts.

Research
------
I didn't have enough time (i.e., wasn't self-motivated enough) to do any projects by myself. 
My brother's paper, which he completed over the summer, was accepted to the [NeurIPS Machine Learning for Health Workshop](https://ml4health.github.io/2019/) as a full paper. 
I am so proud of him and I hope he learned that hard work can pay off. 
(I'm pretty jealous.)

Health & Fitness
------
I originally had hoped to hit 2 plates on the bench press by the end of the year, but I didn't even come close. 

**Meniscectomy.** I had hurt my knee from last December from squatting (I thought I was big), which had previously been diagnosed as an IT band injury. But I went to see an orthopaedic surgeon in SF who did an MRI and told me I had a sizable tear in my meniscus, which I think was from playing tennis. 

**Nose surgeries.** I had a turbinate reduction to help with my breathing/snoring, which is a small procedure.

Reading
------

**The Last Lecture.** Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at CMU, gave a "last lecture" after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
I admire Pausch's communication so much. 
Here are some of the pieces from his book and their takeaways (Chapter \#):

- *Pouring soda in the backseat (15)*. People are more important than things.
- *I'm on my honeymoon, but if you need me... (23)*. Time needs to be managed, like money.
- *Dream big (28)*. Pausch grew up watching man land on the moon.
- *Don't complain, just work harder (32)*.
- *Be the first penguin (39)*. Take big risks.
- *The lost art of thank-you notes (41)*.
- *The friday night solution (43)*. **Q.** What was your secret to getting tenure early? **A.** "It's pretty simple, call me any Friday night in my office at ten o'clock and I'll tell you."
- *Tell the truth (48)*. All the time.
- *No job is beneath you (51)*. 
- *All you have to do is ask (55)*. 
- *Make a decision: Tigger or Eeyore (56)*. "I'm dying and I'm having fun... there's no other way to play it."

His final remarks, which he addressed to his family, touched me dearly.

**Everything is F\*cked: A Book about Hope.** I was excited to read this book because I liked *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* so much. I had a hard time getting through the first half, which talked about this struggle between your feeling brain and your thinking brain (i.e., doing what feels good versus what you know is good in the long run). In the second half of the book, however, Manson brought to light many important concepts. 

- **The Uncomfortable Truth**. You will one day die, and beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief amount of time, nothing you do matters.
- **The Formula of Humanity**. Manson loves Immanuel Kant, who says that the supreme value in the universe is the thing that conceives of value itself (i.e., the humanity is the greatest value). And Manson's formula of humanity therefore states, "Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means." Do something because it's the right thing to do, not beacuse of the outcome.
- **Meditation.** Manson's account of [Quang Duc](http://100photos.time.com/photos/malcolm-browne-burning-monk) moved me, and he describes meditation as "observing the interiors of your mind and heart, in all their horror and glory." 
- **Adulthood versus Adolescence**. While adolescents use principles as a means to get pleasure, adults value principles as ends in and of themselves. Manson defines adulthood as "the realization that sometimes an abstract principle is right and good for it's own sake, that even if it hurts you today, even if it hurts other, being honest is still the right thing to do."

I plan to read this book again in the future and re-evaluate it.

Who are my heroes?
------
* [Randy Pausch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&t=313s) says, "Tell the truth. All the time."
* [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/fuck-yes) has a law of *F\*ck Yes or No*, which says that if you're in the grey area, you've already lost (i.e., if you have to think about it, the answer is no). 
* I loved [Lady Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vheNbQlsyU) in *A Star Is Born*.
* Julianne Moore is great in *Kingsman: The Golden Circle*.
* Most tennis players have an idol that they want to play like (usually Federer, but I like Djokovic more). Well, I code, and my coding idol is my mentor from Blend, Danny Hermes.

Recruiting
------
You probably think it's stupid for me to post the details of job offers that I got, but I don't care. 
I'm an advocate for transparency, and new grad offers are usually pretty standard, and so here it is:

**Offers:**

| Company   | Salary | Signing Bonus | Stock Options     | Offer Date | Acceptance Deadline | Did I think I would get it | 
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Blend     | $125k  | $20k          |                   | Sep 6      | Nov 5               | Unsure                     |
| Thumbtack | $125k  | $15k          | \~$100k RSU/4 yrs | Oct 24     | Nov 15              | No                         |

This is what I didn't get:

**Rejections:**

| Company   | Reject Date | Did I think I would get it (or pass) | Interviews                                           |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| Figma     | Sep 17      | Maybe                                | Phone screen, phone interview                        |
| Benchling | Sep 20      | Yes                                  | Phone screen                                         |
| Coda      | Sep 24      | No                                   | Coding challenge, phone screen, onsite in Bellevue   |
| Robinhood | Oct 8       | Yes                                  | Coding challenge, phone screen, onsite in Menlo Park |
| Affirm    | Nov 5       | Yes                                  | Two phone screens, onsite in SF                      |
| Palantir  | |                                      | Phone screen                                         |

While we're here, I am working on being more comfortable with rejection:
