Intro

Research
------
EACL submission was accepted
ACL was crazy: UID, survey paper, help Ruibo


PhD
------
I applied to PhD programs again, with low expectations. My low expectations were justified: I got rejected from Stanford, MIT, and UW. 


Fitness
------

**Weightlifting.** 


**Tennis.**

Reading

### *High Performance Habits* by Brendan Burchard

### *A Field Guide to Lucid Dreaming*
TODO

### *The Institute* by Steven King
This is another paranormal thriller book by Steven King. It was pretty good (but not as good as *Misery*). The good thing was it was not too spooky, so I didn't get the willies as much before bed.
