Intro lines

Senior Thesis

Living at Home

Coursework
------
**Reading course on self-supervised learning in NLP.**

**Data stream algorithms (CS 35).**

Health & Fitness
------
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, I video called my friends Prahlad and Sully to do a home workout together.
We did Athlean-X's home workout twice a week and Sully's workout once a week. 
I also trained table tennis around 4 times a week with my brother, and we both improved a lot.

Other Research
------
Mentoring my brother for his own research with Saeed has been a big learning experience for me. It gave me some insights from being able to take the perspective of the mentor, and try to use these insights to be a better student. For example, "your boss wants a result, not an excuse."
