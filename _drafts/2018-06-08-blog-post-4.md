This spring quarter, I worked at Oracle (previously Dyn) in Hanover. I spent a lot of time on machine learning projects both at Oracle and for my research since I was not enrolled in classes, and I'm grateful to have been close enough to campus that I could spend time with friends and work as a teaching assistant for a machine learning class.

Oracle
------
Oracle has a small (about 15 people) internet intelligence office right in Hanover, about a mile north of campus. I worked with their internet intelligence data, using machine learning to predict BGP paths and geolocations. We mostly adopted techniques from natural language processing (internet routing paths can be modeled like words in a language), and I wrote code to generate embeddings with negative sampling as well as a deep neural net for geolocation prediction of internet domain names. My boss, Alin, was invested in me and at many times even went over low-level code with me. His creativity and attention to detail inspire me. I liked the people in our office, whom I found to be relaxed yet extremely intelligent. Many of them were dartmouth alumni and had been working together for more than a decade.

I had a couple of observations from working at Oracle. The first is my progress in developing our deep learning model was non-linear. A lot of time was spent on brainstorming, reading papers, cleaning data, and debugging that didn't yield very much progress, whereas most of the big improvements to the model came from things that I was able to code in a few days. I think it really followed the '80-20 rule' where about eighty percent of my results were produced in twenty percent of the time, and the other eighty percent of the time only yielded twenty percent of the results. The other interesting thing that was confirmed by my internship at Oracle is the idea that it is easy for AI to automate tasks that humans can do, but much harder for AI to automate tasks that humans cannot do. In the case of my project, for many of the things we were trying to predict, (1) we did not know if it was even feasible, (2) we could not gather new data, and (3) we were not able to use human insights improve our model since we were unable to do the task ourselves. These challenges make it difficult to build compelling AI. 

Activities
------

I continued working part-time for [Protago Labs](http://protagolab.com/), an small AI company I have been working for since last June. We made solid progress on our conversational chatbot by implementing some of the newer techniques that came out in papers this year.

Research

Without the pressure of classes, I was able to spend a lot more mental time focusing on and thinking about my research in using deep learning to read lung adenocarcinoma microscopy slides. I spent a lot of time cleaning data and working with medical doctors to annotate our dataset. Getting high quality, labeled data has been the bottleneck of progress in our project, and my lesson learned this term is that all resources should be devoted to resolving bottleneck issues until they are solved. As the curator of our dataset, I became extremely familiar with the data and spent many weeks actually learning about the biology of the lung cancer images and how to classify them.

If anyone happens to have a unlabeled lung adenocarcinoma microscopy slide that they need to read but no have access to an actual doctor, I would be more than happy to read it and tell you the cancer pattern and grade. 

Fencing

For fencing this term, we had our most important event of the year, club nationals. We were the first place six-weapon team! I was the alternate for our men's epee squad, which was stacked this year and beat Cornell in the finals to get first place for the men's epee event as well. The last time Dartmouth won first was in 2014, and winning this year was special for our coach Scott, class of 2014, who is graduating this year with his PhD. Scott saw the potential for our team this year and pushed us to be our best. He recently said to me, "Wait, you don't watch fencing everyday before bed?"

TA

I was a TA this term for Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis (COSC 74) with V.S. Subrahmanian. My duties consisted of holding office hours and grading homework assignments and tests. I'm excited that so many people who came to my office hours asked me about deep learning in addition to machine learning. I hope that the administration makes a bigger effort to hire faculty in deep learning, since Dartmouth is considered by many to be the "[birthplace of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)."

Tennis

Spring in Hanover is absolutely beautiful. After not playing at all since the summer, I realized how much I missed tennis (and how out of shape I was). I've decided to make an effort to play tennis more often, since it always puts me in a good mood and is great exercise.

**Living Off-Campus**

I lived off campus in Hartford, VT (about ten minutes by car from campus) in a house with three medical school students. My grandparents, who live in Boston, graciously allowed me to borrow their car for the term since they don't use it much.

Closing

Some weeks were busy, especially a few when work for Oracle, research, and Protago Labs were heavy at the same time.
