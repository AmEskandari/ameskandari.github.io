It hasn't become obvious to me what the goal of mindfulness is exactly. Sam Harris puts it eloquently, which I would summarize as

> Mindfulness teaches you how to not suffer unnecessarily. 
> When you are not mindful, you are lost in thought. The contents of your thoughts color your moment-to-moment experience, and you identify with and become your thoughts. All suffering is a matter of being lost in thought.
> Mindfulness teaches you to aware of thoughts for what they are and to experience life in the present moment. You do not need to ruminate about what just happened, what should happen, or what might yet happen. It allows us to break the spell of being lost in thought.
> As an example of how being lost in thought compounds negative experience, imagine someone driving a nail into your knee. It sounds unbearable, but every moment you feel it, you are actually bearing it. 
When you're thinking about when am I going to get relief, what's the cure, how badly is my knee injured---when you're worrying about the future---, the automaticity of thought amplifies the negativity of the experience. Realize that suffering is the constant fear of having to experience something in the next moment.
> Mindfulness tells us to focus on the present, allowing us to realize that the half-life of negative emotions is incredibly short.

Reading

***Can't Hurt Me* by David Goggins.** This book is the story of David Goggins, an ultra-marathoner and former US Navy SEAL who did 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours, a world record. He tells the incredible story how he learned to embrace pain---to build a calloused mind, as he calls it---from being abused by his father to running with two broken shins and becoming a Navy Seal.

How strong the brain's capacity to tolerate pain is, that most of us only tap into 40% of our capabilities.

***Atomic Habits* by James Clear.** This book, recommended by my friend Ashar, is about how small habits make a big difference. There were a lot of good points from the book:
1. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
1. There is real power from *aggregation of marginal gains*. The British created a world-class cycling team by improving everything that goes into riding a bike by 1%: wearing heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature, testing fabrics in wind tunnel, finding massage gels to aid muscle recovery, finding best way to wash hands and prevent a cold, etc.
1. Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
1. Most people change habits based on what they want to achieve, leading to outcome-based habits. You really want to have *identity-based habits*, which target *who* you want to become. The goal is not to read a book, but rather to *become* a reader. The goal is not to do creative things, but rather to *become* a creative person.
1. Focus on progress and improvement against oneself instead of achieving goals, similar to Simon Sinek's philosophy of playing the infinite game.
1. Clear's laws of building better habits are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

Some actions that I can take to improve my habits:
1. **Systems.** Focus on systems instead of goals. E.g., instead of *publish 2 \*ACL papers this year*, try *read one new paper, try out two new ideas, and do thirty hours of deep work per week*.
1. **Habit tracking.** Move one paper clip from a full jar to an empty jar for \{every hour of deep work, every lecture watched, every paper read\}. 
1. **Accountability.** I made a list of three items to get done this quarter and told my brother to enforce a punishment if I do not complete them. 
1. **Habit stacking.** Arrive to the gym ten minutes early and do Wim Hof breathing. Arrive to tennis ten minutes early and meditate. Take supplements after refilling water. Floss, mouthwash, and moisturize at the same time. 

**Hygge.** To continue to learn more about my interest in Danish culture, I read two books, *Hygge: Cozy Living the Danish Way* by Astrid Neilson and *The Cozy Life* by Pia Edberg. Here's the definition provided by Neilsen: 

> Hygge is about everyday togetherness that brings about that warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Hygge evokes a homey feeling of warmth, comfort safety, and love.

Neilsen thinks of it as an art, a way of living a simple and authentic life by finding joy in the ordinary. 

Edberg takes an extended and more meta- approach, defining hygge as surrounding ourselves with everything we love and treasuring the current moment. 
I like how Edberg describes hygge as not like a raging party, but rather a relaxed and cozy gathering with no worrying.
She also relates hygge to minimalism and urges us to focus on what is important.

Some potential action items for me:
1. Have friends over for hygge gatherings instead of ragers. When they come over, ask if they want to eat or have any food, and have out candles, plants, baked goods, and wine.
1. Hygge at work: add personal items and plants to your desk at work.
1. Hygge scents: cinnamon, vanilla, pumpkin.
1. Some suggested hygge activities: have a bonfire, catch a sunset, have a picnic, take a walk in the snow at night, play board games, write a letter to someone you miss.
1. Reconnecting with my inner child.

"You will never be free until you have no need to impress anyone."

***Positivity* by Phil Hellmuth.** Phil advocates for several things, notably:
1. Write down life goals and create a winning pyramid.
1. Bathroom mirror your yearly goals and your blessings.
1. Shed your hate.
1. Ignore external praise and look to your blessings instead.

Here are my yearly goals (for the next academic year):
1. Write two \*ACL papers.
1. Work with a great advisor.
1. Don't get sick.
1. Bench press 225 pounds.
1. Meditate daily.

Blessings:
1. Great health for me.
1. Great health for my family.
1. Freedom to work on what I love.

(Notably, most of my goals are not the types of goals that James Clear advocates for.)
