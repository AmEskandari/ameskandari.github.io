### *Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise* by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool

The ideas discuss in this book will be life-changing if you can implement them correctly. An overarching observation is that experts have better mental representations than novices do. So the question is how to develop these better mental representations, where more information is processed and instinctively analyzed.

The first concept in the book is *purposeful practice*, which involves (1) having a specific goal, (2) focus, (3) feedback, (4) staying just outside one's comfort zone, and (5) working through temporary plateaus with new techniques and approaches. To be honest, most of the stuff I do, whether it's tennis, or programming, doesn't even meet half the criteria for this bar! Imagine what I'm leaving on the table...

Taking purposeful practice even further, *deliberate practice* further requires both (1) being done in a well-established field, and (2) an experienced coach actively involved in tailoring practice and learning techniques. Unfortunately, being an engineer doesn't qualify, because there isn't accumulated knowledge about deliberate practice, and there is no objective criteria for superior performance.

Luckily, Ericsson and Pool have suggestions for when deliberate practice is not possible. They suggest the following steps:
* Identify the expert performers
* Figure out what they do that makes them so good
* Figure out training techniques that allow you to do it, too.

For moving past plateaus, figure out exactly what is holding you back. Which mistakes are you making and when? Push yourself well outside of your comfort zone and see what breaks down first.

A couple of very motivating anecdotes.
Ben Franklin, when trying to learn to be a good writer, took examples of good writing, distilled them into outlines, and then tried to reproduce the original piece.
Champion swimmers, instead of daydreaming during the movement, pay attention to every detail of performance, "each one done correctly, time and again, until excellence in each detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit". I should do this for lifting.
