**The Year of Living Danishly.** I bought this book because I was interested in comparing my experience in Denmark with someone else's. Helen Russell tells her story of living in rural Jutland for a year while her husband works at Lego. Throughout the book, she tries to figure out why Danes are so happy. Some of the reasons:

* Hygge: feeling of coziness at home with family (especially during the Winter)
* Trusting the system
* Trusting other people
* Everyone gets paid enough, so people do what they enjoy
* Children-centric and family-based life
* They're happy to pay taxes because the government takes care of healthcare, education
* Denmark is rich in culture, holidays, and tradition
* Danish people do a lot of extracurricular activities (i.e., socializing and exercise)
* Danish food is fresh and tasty
* Danes are proud of their country and The Danish Way
* People respect your profession

Reading the book made me nostalgic about my time in Denmark, and I think it would be really helpful to bring "the Danish vibe" to the US.
