Human Programming

One interesting thought that I've been thinking about is how one could "program" oneself in the spirit of self-improvement.
From a first-principles standpoint, the person you currently are is a function of the sum of your past experiences.
This is analogous to a neural network being a function of the data it is trained on. 

As a concrete example, one who reads the work of great writers every day is likely to adopt the style and thought processes of those writers, leading him to produce high quality writing. 
Conversely, someone whose friends are into alcoholism are more likely to value such activities. 

The action item for me comes from the realization that I consume multiple hours of video every day. 
Some video is obviously much higher quality that other video.
For instance, spending a year listening to Sam Harris podcasts will likely be a better influence than watching all the Kali muscle videos on youtube. 
What if I limited my experience consumption to the content most likely to have a positive influence? 

In this vein, here is a list of what I consider positive influences---specifically, how each person can rub off on me positively.

- TV/Movies
	- **Sherlock** (and The Imitation Game): logic, critical thinking, intelligence, nuance
	- **Killing Eve**: humor, smoothness, European culture
	- **Counterpart**: thinking big, being on the world stage
	- **The Great Gatsby Movies**: live an exciting life, old school America
- Public figures
	- **Elon Musk**: first-principles thinking, long-term thinking, dreaming big
	- **Sam Harris**: consciousness, death, honesty
	- **Conan**: humor, high-energy, wit, intelligence, sociability, quick-thinking
	- **Lady Gaga**: creativity, love
	- **David Goggins**: motivation, hard work, taking things to the extreme
- Youtube:
	- **Bald and Bankrupt**: open-mindedness, worldliness
	- **Thomas Afu**: Chinese and European culture, open-mindedness
	- **Andrew Kirby**: productivity, thinking in terms of time
- Writers:
	- **Steven King**: beautiful writing, high standard of prose, dedication to one's craft
	- **Cal Newport**: productivity, meta-career skills
	- **Mark Manson**: being a desirable person
	- **Anchee Min**: vulnerability, honesty
	- **Brendan Burchard**: the lifestyle described in *High Performance Habits*
- Academics:
	- **Randy Pausch**: time, meta-habits
	- **Henry Lee Smith**: old-school thinking, genuine passion for linguistics
	- **Ryan Cotterell**: linguistics, creativity, "thinking like a scientist", love of learning
