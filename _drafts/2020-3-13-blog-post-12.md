**Impact Design (COSC 29).** 

**Love and Desire in Modern Chinese Literature (ASCL 60).**
This class explored a number of short stories and novellas written by Chinese authors from 1900-2000, translated into english.
I interpreted stories from early 1900s as cautionary tales against free love during the time of arranged marriages.

Health & Fitness
------

Physical therapy. I went to see Dr. Samuel Johnson, a physical therapist at the DHMC Heater Road. He told me that my leg muscles were quite tight and that I should stretch my hamstrings and IT bands. He gave me a good program and told me that I should even do weighted squats, which I was pretty wary of doing.
