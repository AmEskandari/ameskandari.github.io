# Travels

One of reasons I wanted to study abroad was so I could travel on weekends. 

Croatia
------
**Zagreb:** Zagreb is a nice little city. We stayed in different family-run hotels (around $70), and they were both within five minutes of the square, which is incredible for the price. I really enjoyed the food there. You could get a full meal at a restaurant for ~$5, and Croatian food is delicious. Croissants and cheesy bread in the street shops were only 1 kuna = 0.15 dollars. Our flight back got canceled, so we got to stay in the five star Sheraton Zagreb. I had a relaxing night there (they had a nice gym and spa). 

**Plitvice Lakes National Park:** This is a beautiful park with wooden walkways. There were multiple layers of lakes, and Prahlad and I had a nice three hour hike. However, this park is terribly crowded (lots of tourists from Korea), even though we went off-season. 

Denmark
------
**Copenhagen:** Copenhagen is a nice-looking city, with great culture and nightlife. I really liked Nyhavn, which is the port with all the colorful shops that you see on all the postcards of Copenhagen. There's a small place about ten minutes from Nyhavn called Christiania, a progressive community that has its own rules and is independent from the Danish government. Trade of cannibis is legal there, so the nightlife and culture is unique. 

**Møns Klint:** When my friend Naren came to visit for the weekend, Naren, Prahlad, and I went to Møns Klint, six kilometers of chalky cliffs in southeast Denmark near the Baltic Sea. We rented car to make the 150km day trip, and it was great! Nothing crazy, but the weather was perfect and the cliffs were beautiful. After, we stopped by a dainty little town nearby called Klintholm Havn to watch the sunset.
