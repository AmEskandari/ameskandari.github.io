# Travels

One of reasons I wanted to study abroad was so I could travel on weekends. 

Denmark
------
**Copenhagen:** Copenhagen is a nice-looking city, with great culture and nightlife. I really liked Nyhavn, which is the port with all the colorful shops that you see on all the postcards of Copenhagen. There's a small place about ten minutes from Nyhavn called Christiania, a progressive community that has its own rules and is independent from the Danish government. Trade of cannibis is legal there, so the nightlife and culture is unique. 

**Møns Klint:** When my friend Naren came to visit for the weekend, Naren, Prahlad, and I went to Møns Klint, six kilometers of chalky cliffs in southeast Denmark near the Baltic Sea. We rented car to make the 150km day trip, and it was great! Nothing crazy, but the weather was perfect and the cliffs were beautiful. After, we stopped by a dainty little town nearby called Klintholm Havn to watch the sunset.
