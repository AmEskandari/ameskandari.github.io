Intro sentence

Research
------
I got rejections for two papers from both AACL and COLING, which was hard to stomach and had me questioning what mistakes I had made with these two papers.
Is it wrong to be upset by rejections and happy for acceptances when there is so much noise in reviewing?
Perhaps this is a call for me to focus more on the systems than the results.


Health and Fitness
------

**Tennis.** 
Some things for me to work on
Better ready position, reading the ball, and recovery. I might not hit like a 5.0 player but I can have the ready position of one. 
On volleys, contact the ball in front while moving forward. If the ball bounces close to your feet, get low and either take it early or off the bounce. 
For serves, toss the ball higher.
On backhands, make sure to keep the left arm bent on the backswing, and then flex the chest with my left hand pointing backwards when hitting the ball.
Red light yellow light green light: a great exercise for reading the ball. 

**Weightlifting.** 

**Murph.**

Reading

### *A Field Guide to Lucid Dreaming*

### *Metaphors We Live By*

### *The Outsider* by Stephen King
I hold Stephen King to high standards, and this book did not turn out the way I had hoped. 
It starts with the murder of a boy with unmistakable evidence, but the man charged has a rock-solid alibi: what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?
I thought there would be a real solution to the story, but it turned out to be supernatural. 
Still, reading Stephen King has improved my writing vocabulary and creativity noticeably.
